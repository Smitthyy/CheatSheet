# CheatSheet
My personal cheat sheet

This project is my first and hopefully something I will find useful and refer/add to often with new items as a quick reference guide for my web development journey!

Initial aims are:

A list of useful expressions to be used when writing html and css with a brief description of each.

Sorting by A-Z - clicking the relevent a-z will skip to that section of the page to enable quick reference and searching.
